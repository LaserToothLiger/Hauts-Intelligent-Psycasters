<!--Mod settings-->
<HVPAA_SettingPAI>NPC psycast attempt interval</HVPAA_SettingPAI>
<HVPAA_TooltipAttemptInterval>The frequency with which non-player-controlled psycasters periodically attempt to use a psycast.\n\nIf a psycaster is in combat when this occurs, their psycasting frequency will temporarily quadruple.\n\nSome factions have special, visually distinct psycasters which ignore this setting (e.g. the Empire's court psycasters).</HVPAA_TooltipAttemptInterval>
<HVPAA_SettingMCPL>Psycast choices per attempt</HVPAA_SettingMCPL>
<HVPAA_TooltipChoices>When a non-player-controlled pawn attempts to psycast, it first ranks all psycasts in its repertoire by their broad, simplified applicability to the current situation. It will only actually consider casting the X "most applicable" psycasts, where X is the value of this setting. If X is low, very few calculations will need to be done, but NPC psycasters will have clear "favorite" psycasts, making them predictable. If X is high, the calculations per attempt may be higher, but NPC psycasters will display a wider variety of abilities.</HVPAA_TooltipChoices>
<HVPAA_SettingSellcastB>Sellcast known psycasts multiplier</HVPAA_SettingSellcastB>
<HVPAA_TooltipSellcastB>Increases the base number of psycasts known by sellcasts.\n\nOnly affects sellcasts that have yet to appear - does not affect sellcasts that have already been encountered.</HVPAA_TooltipSellcastB>
<HVPAA_SettingShow>Show NPC caster levels</HVPAA_SettingShow>
<HVPAA_TooltipShow>If enabled, any non-player-controlled psycaster will be labeled with a tag showing its psylink level (and in parentheses, the sum level of all its psycasts). I recommend keeping this on so that you can identify any psycasters in a raid at a glance.\n\nAfter toggling this on or off, expect a bit of an in-game delay before the labels appear or vanish.</HVPAA_TooltipShow>
<HVPAA_SettingNotifs>Red letter notifications for Most Dangerous psycasts</HVPAA_SettingNotifs>
<HVPAA_TooltipNotifs>If enabled, you will receive a red letter notification when an NPC controlled psycaster uses one of the Most Dangerous psycasts (e.g. Neuroquake). Single-target Most Dangerous psycasts only cause a red letter if used on a player-owned target.\n\nI heavily recommend keeping this on.</HVPAA_TooltipNotifs>
<HVPAA_SettingPowerLimits>AI is nerfed/stupid when using Very Dangerous psycasts</HVPAA_SettingPowerLimits>
<HVPAA_TooltipPowerLimits>If enabled, psycasts that can instantly kill or are otherwise very unfair are either 1) much less likely to be used by NPC psycasters, 2) likelier to pick a suboptimal target, and/or 3) take longer to cast.\n\nDepending on what mods you use, turning this off can be very dangerous - don't say I didn't warn you!</HVPAA_TooltipPowerLimits>
<HVPAA_SettingNicerPsycasters>"Nicer" psycasters</HVPAA_SettingNicerPsycasters>
<HVPAA_TooltipNicerPsycasters>If enabled, most neutral psycasters will use their psycasts as if you (and anyone else they are neutral to) are allied to them. Most NPC psycasters will also more strongly favor “defense” and “healing” psycasts over “damage” or “debuff” psycasts.</HVPAA_TooltipNicerPsycasters>
<HVPAA_SettingPCF>Non-player psycaster commonality factor</HVPAA_SettingPCF>
<HVPAA_TooltipPCF>Multiplies the number of random casters you will encounter. Also scales the likelihood of encountering spec casters as inhabitants of world sites or as raiders, as well as the number of such spec casters.\n\n&lt;color=#33d733&gt;WARNING:&lt;/color&gt; obviously, the more non-player psycasters there are on the map, the worse performance will get. Cranking this up all the way will make nearly half of all tribal raiders psycasters, at which point any sufficiently large raid will cause stuttering. Consider adjusting other mod settings to reduce the amount of calculations done by each psycaster.</HVPAA_TooltipPCF>
<HVPAA_UsabilityHeader>Enable AI use of the following psycasts:</HVPAA_UsabilityHeader>
